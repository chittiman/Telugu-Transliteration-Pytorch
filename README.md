# Telugu-Transliteration-Pytorch
Transliterating romanized words to telugu script words

Foremost, this is an INCOMPLETE PROJECT. 

I've started the project in Pytorch and then later shifted to Tensorflow, where I've completed my project made an app and deployed it.
Here I am publishing this repo, so that it might be of some use to anyone interested in trying this in Pytorch.

Steps completed till now in the projet:

1) Cleaned the dataset (minor changes)
2) Created multiple types of datasets from raw datasets
3) Created tokenizers for both source and target words
4) Created Dataloaders for Pytorch
5) Created overfit functions(to check model capacity) and train function (to train the model)

Leftover part - Train the function, Log the metrics, search the hyperparameter space
